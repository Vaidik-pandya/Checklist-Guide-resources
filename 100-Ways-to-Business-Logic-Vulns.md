## 1–10: Core Business Logic Vulnerabilities and Discovery Tips  
1. **Bypassing Workflow State Checks**  
   - *Discovery:* Attempt skipping mandatory steps or states in multi-step processes (e.g., checkout without payment).  
2. **Repeated Actions to Abuse Discounts or Limits (Race Conditions)**  
   - *Tip:* Trigger the same action multiple times simultaneously to bypass limits (e.g., buy 1 item but get multiple discounts).  
3. **Price or Quantity Manipulation Before Purchase Finalization**  
   - *Discovery:* Tamper client or API data with modified prices, quantities, or discount codes out of intended order.  
4. **Authorization Assumptions in Business Functions**  
   - *Tip:* Access or invoke admin-only features by calling APIs or endpoints without proper privilege checks.  
5. **Excessive Trust in Client-Side Validation**  
   - *Discovery:* Bypass JavaScript form validations by intercepting and modifying requests with a proxy.  
6. **Bypassing Captcha or Rate Limits via Logical Flaws**  
   - *Tip:* Find alternative flows lacking captcha or rate limiting controls.  
7. **Manipulating Inventory or Resource Allocations**  
   - *Discovery:* Attempt to reserve or order more items than available; test concurrency and stock adjustment logic.  
8. **Using Invalid or Expired Tokens to Bypass Checks**  
   - *Tip:* Replay or craft tokens (CSRF, anti-forgery) to bypass sanity checks.  
9. **Bypassing Payment or Fraud Checks via Business Logic Flaws**  
   - *Discovery:* Test login or purchase flows with forged or skipped payment status.  
10. **Manipulating User Roles or Permissions via Logical Gaps**  
    - *Tip:* Modify request parameters to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access.

## 11–20: Advanced Logic Flaws Exploitation Techniques  
11. **Breaking Multi-Tenant Isolation via Logic Flaws**  
    - *Discovery:* Access or manipulate data belonging to other tenants by tweaking tenant or org IDs.  
12. **Session and Token Logic Bugs Leading to Unauthorized Actions**  
    - *Tip:* Test reusing expired or revoked sessions or tokens to gain access.  
13. **Inconsistent State Handling Between Microservices**  
    - *Discovery:* Exploit asynchronous or out-of-sync APIs causing inconsistent validation.  
14. **Logic Flaws in Refund or Cancellation Workflows**  
    - *Tip:* Cancel transactions multiple times or refund without valid payments.  
15. **Abuse of Bulk or Batch Operations Missing Validation**  
    - *Discovery:* Submit bulk requests with mixed valid/invalid data to cause unexpected outcomes.  
16. **Forceful Browsing to Restricted Business Functions**  
    - *Tip:* Manually access URLs or API endpoints intended for specific workflows or user roles.  
17. **Weak Validation of Linked Resources in Business Transactions**  
    - *Discovery:* Link to invalid or malicious resources to bypass content or workflow rules.  
18. **Exploiting Incorrect Business Assumptions About Timing or Sequencing**  
    - *Tip:* Perform actions out of intended order to bypass checks (e.g., access premium content before payment).  
19. **Abuse of Discount or Referral Codes Beyond Intended Scope**  
    - *Discovery:* Chain or reuse promo codes in unintended ways.  
20. **Insecure Assumptions in Third-Party Integrations Affecting Logic**  
    - *Tip:* Manipulate data or event payloads from external services to cause business logic flaws.

## Summary  
Business logic vulnerabilities arise from flawed assumptions, missing state validation, and improper handling of workflows or privileges. They often cannot be detected automatically and require creative, human-led testing approaches that simulate unexpected user or system behaviors. Securing business logic demands rigorous server-side validation, comprehensive workflow verification, and continuous security awareness integrated into the software development lifecycle.
